# sparta-weekend-game-SIMON

The aim was to try and build the game called Simon over a weekend in an attempt to improve my development skills. Although , I did not manage to complete it, I managed to get the game to generate random colours in a random pattern. Once the colours finished lighting up, the user is prompted to copy the pattern. If the user completes the pattern correctly, a prompt message appears saying that the user has won the round.

## Instructions to play the the game

After cloning the repository, run the following command in the terminal:

    git clone git@github.com:solufemi91/sparta-weekend-game.git

Then enter the main folder by :

    cd sparta-weekend-game

And then:

    open index.html

This command will open the webpage for the game.
